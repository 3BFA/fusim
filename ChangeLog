	- Added conversion option to convert from GFF/GTF to refFlat genePred
	  format. Should behave similiar to gtfToGenePred utility from Ken source
	  utilities

	  chromosomes (ignore chroms which contain "_")
	- Added option to control number of threads to spawn when processing
	  background BAM file
	- Added option to configure RPKM cutoff value

	  utility to convert GTF files to refFlat format.

	- Implemented generation of read through fusion genes. Added option for
	  specifying the number of read through fusion events to generate.
