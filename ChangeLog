Fusim - ChangeLog
================================================================================

- 2012-07-01 (v0.0.3)

	- Added support for executing external program (ART) to simulate Illumina
	  reads from generated fusion genes.
	- Added option to align simulated reads from ART using Bowtie. 
	- Added option to merge resulting alignments with background dataset.

- 2012-06-30 (v0.0.2)
	- Added conversion option to convert from GFF/GTF to refFlat genePred
	  format. Should behave similiar to gtfToGenePred utility from Ken source
	  utilities
	- Only use canonical chromosomes. Skip the haplotypes and unassembled
	  chromosomes (ignore chroms which contain "_")
	- Added option to control number of threads to spawn when processing
	  background BAM file
	- Added option to configure RPKM cutoff value

- 2012-06-29 (v0.0.1)
	- Re-factored GeneModelParser to use refFlat instead of refGene. Added a
	  utility to convert GTF files to refFlat format.
	- Added GTF parser. Updated code to use Strand enum.
	- Implemented generation of read through fusion genes. Added option for
	  specifying the number of read through fusion events to generate.
	- Added output to both FASTA and TXT formats.
	- Added option to include only CDS exons or all exons when generating
	  fusion genes
