	- Ported the mkFromGroupedGxf(..) function from Ken source utilities. The
	  conversion should behave similiar to gtfToGenePred utility

	  utility to convert GTF files to refFlat format.
	- Added GTF parser. Updated code to use Strand enum.
	- Implemented generation of read through fusion genes. Added option for
	  specifying the number of read through fusion events to generate.
	- Added output to both FASTA and TXT formats.
	- Added option to include only CDS exons or all exons when generating
	  fusion genes
