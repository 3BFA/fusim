Fusim - ChangeLog
================================================================================

- 2012-07-05 (v0.0.4)

    - Removed options for ART and bowtie.
	- Fixed text output for generated fusion genes to be more like refFlat
	  gene prediction format.
	- Refactored gene selection method. Added new option for selecting the
	  method to use for selecting genes to include in fusions. Valid methods
	  are uniform, empirical, or binned. The uniform method selects 2
	  genes at random to include in a fusion. The empirical method randomly
	  selects 2 genes based on the empirical distribution of the given
	  background dataset using RPKM. The binned method computes the RPKM value
	  and sorts genes into n bins. Two genes from each bin are then selected
	  for fusions. 
    - Added option to force fusions breaks on exon boundries.
	- Added option to allow generation of fusion genes outside of reading
	  frames
	- Added option to auto-correct orientation of genes selected for a fusion
	  if located on different strands.

- 2012-07-01 (v0.0.3)

	- Added support for executing external program (ART) to simulate Illumina
	  reads from generated fusion genes.
	- Added option to align simulated reads from ART using Bowtie. 
	- Added option to merge resulting alignments with background dataset.

- 2012-06-30 (v0.0.2)

	- Added conversion option to convert from GFF/GTF to refFlat genePred
	  format. Should behave similiar to gtfToGenePred utility from Ken source
	  utilities
	- Only use canonical chromosomes. Skip the haplotypes and unassembled
	  chromosomes (ignore chroms which contain "_")
	- Added option to control number of threads to spawn when processing
	  background BAM file
	- Added option to configure RPKM cutoff value

- 2012-06-29 (v0.0.1)

	- Re-factored GeneModelParser to use refFlat instead of refGene. Added a
	  utility to convert GTF files to refFlat format.
	- Added GTF parser. Updated code to use Strand enum.
	- Implemented generation of read through fusion genes. Added option for
	  specifying the number of read through fusion events to generate.
	- Added output to both FASTA and TXT formats.
	- Added option to include only CDS exons or all exons when generating
	  fusion genes
